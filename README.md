# ESP32-VSC-DVD-STEPPER
**What does it do?**
This simple piece of code controls a small stepper motor you can find in a DVD or CD player.

**how does it work?**
connect an ESP32 to an [easydriver](https://www.tinytronics.nl/shop/en/mechanics-and-actuators/motor-controllers-and-drivers/stepper-motor-controllers-and-drivers/a3967-easydriver-stepper-motor-controller) controller
(an ESP32 works with 3.3V signals. To prepare the easydriver to be compatible with an ESP32 be sure to connect the solder "jumper" on the easydriver)
